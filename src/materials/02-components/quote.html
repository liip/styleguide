  If you don’t have an appropriate picture to illustrate your quote, you can simply drop the whole `.quote__avatar` element.

<div class="quote">
  <div class="quote__avatar">
    <a href="#" class="avatar" style="background-image:url('/assets/fabricator/images/rita.jpg')"></a>
  </div>
  <blockquote class="quote__text">
    <p>An empowering quote that could lead to a second line for some obvious reasons I wouldn’t mention.</p>
    <cite class="quote__cite"><span class="quote__author">Rita Barracha</span>, User Experience Designer</cite>
  </blockquote>
</div>
